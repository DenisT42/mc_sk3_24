<section class="about">
  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Marine Clean-Up is committed to restoring our planet's water bodies by removing waste, promoting sustainable practices, and educating communities. Our efforts contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water).</p>
</section>

<section class="problem">
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Over 8 million tons of plastic enter our oceans every year, endangering marine life and ecosystems. Rivers and lakes also suffer from pollution, impacting local biodiversity and communities that rely on them for clean water. Without action, these vital ecosystems face collapse.</p>
</section>

<section class="solution">
  <h2>Our Solution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Oceans:</strong> Monthly beach cleanup events and deployment of innovative technologies to remove waste.</li>
    <li><strong>Lakes and Rivers:</strong> Starting in Germany, we are expanding to clean local rivers and lakes to restore freshwater ecosystems.</li>
    <li><strong>Education Programs:</strong> Workshops and partnerships with schools to spread awareness about the importance of sustainable water management.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="plans">
  <h2>Our Future Plans</h2>
  <p>While we begin in Germany, our long-term vision is to scale operations across Europe, targeting polluted lakes, rivers, and coastal regions. We aim to collaborate with local governments, NGOs, and volunteers to build a sustainable network for ongoing cleanups.</p>
